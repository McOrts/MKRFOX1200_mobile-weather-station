# Mobile weather station based on Arduino MKRFOX1200
The arduino MKRFOX1200 with connection to Sigfox has taken the democratization of the use of microcontrollers to the space of the IOT and the cloud.

This project will put on your cell phone the basic weather information collected in real time by a mobile device that you can "abandon" in a large part of the world.

IOT Concept
-----------

The Internet of Things is a network of connected devices which communicate over the Internet, and they do so autonomously, machine to machine, without the need for human intervention.

The first reference to the IoT was in 1982, when researchers at Carnegie Mellon University developed the world’s first IoT-enabled Coke Machine. Mark Weiser developed the concept further in the early 90s; and Kevin Ashton coined the term ‘Internet of Things’ around 1999.

What's Sigfox and why we need it?
