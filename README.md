# Mobile weather station based on Arduino MKRFOX1200
The arduino MKRFOX1200 with connection to Sigfox has taken the democratization of the use of microcontrollers to the space of the IOT and the cloud.
This project will put on your cell phone the basic weather information collected in real time by a mobile device that you can "leave" in a large part of the world.
